**Woohoo Labs. Harmony is a flexible micro-framework developed for PHP applications.**

Our aim was to create an invisible, easily extensible, and most importantly,an extremely flexible framework for your
quality application. We wanted to give you total control via
[PSR-7](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-7-http-message.md) and
[Container-Interop](https://github.com/container-interop/container-interop).

## Introduction

#### Rationale

This post summarizes the reasons behind Harmony's birth: http://www.catonmat.net/blog/frameworks-dont-make-sense/ 

#### Features

- Extreme flexibility through middleware
- High performance due to simple and clean design
- Full control over HTTP messages via PSR-7
- Support for any IoC Containers via Container-Interop

#### Why Harmony?

There are a lot of very similar middleware dispatcher libraries out there, like
[Zend-Stratigility](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-stratigility/),
[Slim Framework 3](http://www.slimframework.com/docs/concepts/middleware.html) or [Relay](http://relayphp.com/).
So what is the purpose of yet another library with the same functionality?

We believe Harmony is superior to the others in two key things:

- It is the simplest of all. Although simplicity is subjective, one thing is for sure: Harmony offers the least
functionality which is minimally needed. It doesn't have capabilities which are not truly required. That's why Harmony
fits into a single class of 200 lines.

- Starting from version 3, Harmony natively supports the concept of [Conditions](#defining-conditions) which is a unique
feature for middleware dispatchers. This eases dealing with a major weakness of the middleware-oriented approach, which 
is being able to invoke middleware conditionally.

#### Use Cases of Woohoo Labs. Harmony

Certainly, Harmony won't suit the needs of all projects and teams: this framework works best for advanced teams. Less
experienced teams should probably choose a less lenient framework, with more features, in order to speed up development in
the initial phase. Harmony's flexibility is most advantageous when your software is a long-term, strategic project.
That's why legacy applications can also benefit from Harmony, because it eases gradual refactoring.

#### Concepts

Woohoo Labs. Harmony is built upon two main concepts: middleware which promote separation of concerns and
common interfaces allowing you to band your favourite tools together.

Middleware makes it possible to modify the course of action of the request-response lifecycle: you can
authenticate before routing, do some logging after the response has been sent, or you can even dispatch multiple routes
in one request. These can be achieved because everything in Harmony is a middleware, so the framework itself
only consists of 200 lines of code. That's why there is no framework-wide configuration, only middleware can
be configured. What you do with Harmony depends on your imagination and needs.

But middleware must work in cooperation (the router and the dispatcher are particularly tightly coupled to each other).
That's why it is also important to provide common interfaces for the distinct components of the framework.

Naturally, we decided to use [PSR-7](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-7-http-message.md)
for modelling the HTTP request and response. In order to facilitate the usage of different IoC Containers, we adapted
the [Container-Interop standard interface](https://github.com/container-interop/container-interop) which is supported by
various containers off-the-shelf.

#### Middleware Interface Design

Woohoo Labs. Harmony's middleware interface design is based on the "request, response, next" style advocated
by prominent developers such as [Matthew Weier O'Phinney](https://mwop.net/) (you can read more on the topic
[in his blog post](https://mwop.net/blog/2015-01-08-on-http-middleware-and-psr-7.html)). This style - often
called "double pass" or "functional" style - is the current de-facto standard among PHP middleware dispatchers, and also
supported by major vendors like [Zend-Stratigility](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-stratigility/),
[Slim Framework 3](http://www.slimframework.com/) and [Relay](http://relayphp.com/).

If you want to learn about the specifics of this style, please refer to the following introductions which describe this
very concept:

- [Middleware logic in Relay PHP](http://relayphp.com/#middleware-logic) 
- [How does middleware work in Slim 3?](http://www.slimframework.com/docs/concepts/middleware.html#how-does-middleware-work)

#### Additional Middleware

Besides the built-in middleware and the ones for the compatible middleware dispatcher libraries, you can find
various other third party middleware available for Harmony:

- [Woohoo Labs. Yin-Middleware](https://github.com/woohoolabs/yin-middleware): A bunch of middleware to integrate
[Woohoo Labs. Yin](https://github.com/woohoolabs/harmony) - the elegant JSON API framework - into Harmony.
- [PSR-7 Middlewares](https://github.com/oscarotero/psr7-middlewares): A collection of PSR-7 middleware from Oscar Otero
- [MiniUrl](https://github.com/mtymek/MiniUrl): A simple URL shortener, which can be used as a free, open-source
replacement for bit.ly's core functionality: creating short links and redirecting users.

## Install

The steps of this process are quite straightforward. The only thing you need is [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

#### Require a PSR-7 implementation:

As Harmony requires a PSR-7 implementation (a package which provides the `http-message-implementation` virtual package), you must install one first. You may use Zend Diactoros or your preferred library:

```bash
$ composer require zendframework/zend-diactoros
```

#### Add Harmony to your composer.json:

To install this library, run the command below and to get the latest version:

```bash
$ composer require woohoolabs/harmony
```

#### Require the necessary dependencies:

If you want to use the default middleware then you have to ask for the following dependencies too:

```bash
$ composer require nikic/fast-route:^1.0.0
$ composer require zendframework/zend-diactoros:^2.3.0
```

## Basic Usage

#### Define Your Endpoints:

The following example applies only if you use the
[default dispatcher middleware](https://github.com/woohoolabs/harmony/blob/master/src/Middleware/DispatcherMiddleware.php).
There are two important things to note here: first, each endpoint receives a `Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface`
and a `Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface` object and they are expected to manipulate and return the latter.
Second, you are not forced to only use classes for the endpoints, it is possible to define other callables too (see
below in the routing section).

```php
namespace App\Controllers;

use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;

class UserController
{
    /**
     * @param ServerRequestInterface $request
     * @param ResponseInterface $response
     * @return ResponseInterface
     */
    public function getUsers(ServerRequestInterface $request, ResponseInterface $response)
    {
        $users = ["Steve", "Arnie", "Jason", "Bud"];
        $response->getBody()->write(json_encode($users));
        
        return $response;
    }

    /**
     * @param ServerRequestInterface $request
     * @param ResponseInterface $response
     * @return ResponseInterface
     */
     public function updateUser(ServerRequestInterface $request, ResponseInterface $response)
     {
        $userId = $request->getAttribute("id");
        $userData = $request->getParsedBody();

        // Updating user...
        
        return $response;
     }
}
```

#### Define Your Routes:

The following example applies only if you use the
[default router middleware](https://github.com/woohoolabs/harmony/blob/master/src/Middleware/FastRouteMiddleware.php)
which is based on [FastRoute](https://github.com/nikic/FastRoute), the library of Nikita Popov. We chose to use this
library by default because of its performance and elegance. You can read more about it
[in Nikita's blog](http://nikic.github.io/2014/02/18/Fast-request-routing-using-regular-expressions.html).

Let's add three routes to FastRoute:

```php
$router = FastRoute\simpleDispatcher(function(FastRoute\RouteCollector $r) {
    $r->addRoute("GET", "/me", function (ServerRequestInterface $request, ResponseInterface $response) {
        $response->getBody()->write("Welcome to the real world!");
        
        return $response;
    });
    
    $r->addRoute("GET", "/users", [\App\Controllers\UserController::class, "getUsers"]);
    $r->addRoute("POST", "/users/{id}", [\App\Controllers\UserController::class, "updateUser"]);
};
```

#### Finally, Launch The App:

```php
use WoohooLabs\Harmony\Harmony;
use WoohooLabs\Harmony\Middleware\FastRouteMiddleware;
use WoohooLabs\Harmony\Middleware\DispatcherMiddleware;
use WoohooLabs\Harmony\Middleware\DiactorosResponderMiddleware;
use Zend\Diactoros\ServerRequestFactory;
use Zend\Diactoros\Response;
use Zend\Diactoros\Response\SapiEmitter;

$harmony = new Harmony(ServerRequestFactory::fromGlobals(), new Response());
$harmony
    ->addMiddleware(new DiactorosResponderMiddleware(new SapiEmitter()))
    ->addMiddleware(new FastRouteMiddleware($router))
    ->addMiddleware(new DispatcherMiddleware());

$harmony();
```

You have to register all the prior middleware in order for the framework to function properly:
- `DiactorosResponderMiddleware` sends the response to the ether via
[Zend Diactoros](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-diactoros)
- `FastRouteMiddleware` takes care of routing (`$router`  was configured in the previous step)
- `DispatcherMiddleware` dispatches a controller which belongs to the request's current route

Note that there is a second optional argument of `Harmony::addMiddleware()` with which you can define the ID of a
middleware (doing so is necessary if you want to call `Harmony::getMiddleware()` somewhere in your code).

Of course, it is completely up to you how you add additional middleware or how you replace them with your own
implementations. When you'd like to go live, just call `$harmony()`!

## Advanced Usage

#### Using invokable controllers

Most of the time, you will define your route handlers (~controller actions) as regular callables like it
was seen in the section about the default router:

```php
$r->addRoute("GET", "/users/me", [\App\Controllers\UserController::class, "getMe"]);
```

But nowadays, there is an increasing popularity of controllers containing only one action. To do so, it is a general
practice to implement the `__invoke()` magic method. In former versions of Harmony, if you wanted to apply this pattern,
you had to define the example route above the following way (at least if you used the default router and dispatcher):
  
```php
$r->addRoute("GET", "/users/me", [\App\Controllers\GetMe::class, "__invoke"]);
```

As of Harmony 2.1.0, your route definition can be simplified to:

```php
$r->addRoute("GET", "/users/me", \App\Controllers\GetMe::class);
```

Note: If you use other router or dispatcher than the default ones, please make sure whether the feature is
available for you.

If you are interested in how you could benefit from invokable controllers in the context of the
Action-Domain-Responder pattern, you can find an insightful description in
[Paul M. Jones' blog post](http://paul-m-jones.com/archives/6006).

#### Using Your Favourite DI Container with Harmony

The motivation of creating Woohoo Labs. Harmony was to become able to change every single aspect
of the framework. That's why you can whatever DI Container you want.

For this purpose, we chose
the [Container-Interop standard](https://github.com/container-interop/container-interop)
(it is PSR-11 now) to be the common interface for DI Containers in the built-in `DispatcherMiddleware`.

It's also important to know that the `DispatcherMiddleware` uses the `BasicContainer` by default. It's nothing more
than a very silly DIC which tries to create objects based on their class name (so calling 
`$basicContainer->get(Foo::class)` would create a new `Foo` instance).

But if you provide an argument to the middleware's constructor, you can use your favourite Container-Interop compliant
DIC too. Let's have a look at an example where one would like to swap `BasicContainer` with the awesome
[PHP-DI](http://php-di.org):

```php
$container = new \DI\Container();
$harmony->addMiddleware(new DispatcherMiddleware($container));
```

#### Creating Custom Middleware

In order to avoid some initial confusion, please ensure that you know the basics and gotchas of the "request, response,
next" middleware interface design before creating your first own middleware. You can have a look at
[the section about this topic](#middleware-interface-design).

It's not a big deal to add a new middleware to your stack. For a basic scenario, you can use anonymous functions.
Let's say you would like to log all the requests:

```php
$middleware = function (ServerRequestInterace $request, ResponseInterface $response, callable $next) use ($logger) {
    // Perform logging before handling the request
    $logger->logInfo("Request needs to be handled");
    
    // Invoking the remaining middleware
    $response = $next();
    
    // Perform logging after the request has been handled
    $logger->logInfo("Request was successfuly handled");

    // Return to the previous middleware
    return $response;
}
```

And then you have to attach the middleware to Harmony:

```php
$harmony->addMiddleware($middleware);
```

If you want to pass a manipulated request or response to the next middleware, you should call
`$next($request, $response)`. This way, the following middleware will receive the modified request or response.
Calling `$next(null, $response)` will pass the original request and the possibly changed response to the next
middleware!

If you need more sophistication, you can use a `Closure` as a middleware too. 
Let's create an authentication middleware to demonstrate this feature:

```php
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;

class AuthenticationMiddleware
{
    /**
     * @var string
     */
    protected $apiKey;

    /**
     * @param string $apiKey
     */
    public function __construct($apiKey)
    {
        $this->apiKey = $apiKey;
    }

    /**
     * @param ServerRequestInterface $request
     * @param ResponseInterface $response
     * @param callable $next
     * @return ResponseInterface
     */
    public function __invoke(ServerRequestInterface $request, ResponseInterface $response, callable $next)
    {
        if ($request->getHeader("x-api-key") !== [$this->apiKey]) {
            return $response->withStatusCode(401);
        }
        
        return $next();
    }
}
```

Then 

```php
$harmony->addMiddleware(new AuthenticationMiddleware("123"));
```

As you can see, the constructor receives the API Key, while the `__invoke()` method is responsible for performing the
authentication.

Instead of `callable`, you can also typehint the `$next` argument against `Harmony` according to
[`HarmonyMiddlewareInterface`](https://github.com/woohoolabs/harmony/blob/master/src/Middleware/HarmonyMiddlewareInterface.php).
By implementing this interface, you can use some specific features of Harmony (like `Harmony::getMiddleware()`) but lose
the ability to reuse your middleware in other frameworks.

### Defining Conditions

Non-trivial applications often need some kind of branching during the execution of their middleware pipeline. A possible
use-case is when they want to perform authentication only for some of their endpoints or when they want to check for a
CSRF token if the request method is `POST`. With Harmony 2 branching was also easy to handle, but Harmony 3 helps you to
optimize the performance of conditional logic in your middleware.

Let's revisit our authentication middleware example from the last section! This time, we only want to authenticate
endpoints below the `/user` path. In Harmony 2, we would have to achieve it with something like this:

```php
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;

class AuthenticationMiddleware
{
    /**
     * @var string
     */
    protected $securedPath;

    /**
     * @var MyAuthenticatorInterface
     */
    protected $authenticator;

    /**
     * @param string $securedPath
     * @param MyAuthenticatorInterface $authenticator
     */
    public function __construct($securedPath, MyAuthenticatorInterface $authenticator)
    {
        $this->securedPath = $securedPath;
        $this->authenticator = $authenticator;
    }

    /**
     * @param ServerRequestInterface $request
     * @param ResponseInterface $response
     * @param callable $next
     * @return ResponseInterface
     */
    public function __invoke(ServerRequestInterface $request, ResponseInterface $response, callable $next)
    {
         // Invoke the next middleware and cancel authentication if the current URL is for a public endpoint
        if (substr($request->getUri()->getPath(), 0, strlen($this->securedPath)) !== $this->securedPath) {
            return $next();
        }
    
        // Return Error 401 if authentication fails
        if ($this->authenticator->authenticate($request) === false) {
            return $response->withStatusCode(401);
        }
        
        // Invoke the next middleware otherwise
        return $next();
    }
}
```

And finally attach the middleware to Harmony:

```php
$harmony->addMiddleware(new AuthenticationMiddleware("/user", new ApiKeyAuthenticator("123")));
```

You only had to check the current URI inside the middleware and the problem was solved. The downside of doing this is
that `AuthenticationMiddleware` and all its dependencies are instantiated for each request although authentication
is not needed at all! This can be a major inconvenience if you depend on a big object graph.

In Harmony 3, however, you are able to use conditions in order to optimize the number of objects created. In this case
you can utilize the built-in `PathPrefixCondition`. You only have to attach it to Harmony:

```php
$harmony->addCondition(
    new PathPrefixCondition(["/users"]),
    function (Harmony $harmony) {
        $harmony->addMiddleware(new AuthenticationMiddleware("/user", new ApiKeyAuthenticator("123")));
    }
);
```

This way, `AuthenticationMiddleware` will only be instantiated when `PathPrefixCondition` evaluates to `true` (when the
current URI path starts with `/users`). Furthermore, you are able to attach more middleware to Harmony in the anonymous
function. They will be executed together, as if they were part of a containing middleware.

Here is a complete list of the built-in conditions:

- [`ExactPathCondition`](https://github.com/woohoolabs/harmony/blob/master/src/Condition/ExactPathCondition.php):
Evaluates to true if the current URI path exactly matches any of the allowed paths.

- [`PathPrefixCondition`](https://github.com/woohoolabs/harmony/blob/master/src/Condition/PathPrefixCondition.php):
Evaluates to true if the current URI path starts with any of the allowed path prefixes.

- [`HttpMethodCondition`](https://github.com/woohoolabs/harmony/blob/master/src/Condition/HttpMethodCondition.php):
Evaluates to true if the current HTTP method matches any of the allowed HTTP methods.

## Examples

Have a look at the [examples directory](https://github.com/woohoolabs/harmony/blob/master/examples/) for a really basic
application structure. Don't forget to run `composer install` first in Harmony's root directory if you want to try it out!
